# CTS-Personas
Translational workforce roles and persona profiles

This project will encompass and describe the diversity of roles in the clinical and translational science ecosystem. By identifying CTS roles, establishing a persona to represent each role, and providing each persona with a profile, we will document the needs, motivations, goals, and pain points in CTS roles that will be used to inform software development, use cases, teaching materials, and more for the CTSA community.
