# Research Design
The concept of the translational workforce is an important one and plays a prominent role in the work and communication of CTSA Program hubs, NCATS, and beyond. However, to date, a defined list of translational workforce roles in CTS does not exist. Here, we aim to better define the specific roles included in the translational workforce, establish a set of personas to reflect those roles, construct a portfolio of these persona profiles, and disseminate broadly to the CTSA program and to the CD2H for use in development of use cases, communications, training materials, and more.

# Methodology
The Personas project represents a major multi-site collaboration with deep engagement by project partners.  The team meets every 2 weeks and is supported by clearly communicated expectations and timelines.  

This project will encompass and describe the diversity of roles in the clinical and translational science ecosystem. By identifying CTS roles, establishing a persona to represent each role, and providing each persona with a profile, we will document the needs, motivations, goals, and pain points in CTS roles that will be used to inform software development, use cases, teaching materials, and more for the CTSA community. The process includes:
- Identify relevant roles in CTS through a literature search, interviews, and other feedback
- Develop 1-pagers on each persona about that “person” – their job, motivations, pain points, types of types of data, software tools, training resources, etc. that each persona would want to access, etc.
- Get input and iterate
- Once in good shape, develop some exemplar use cases and documentation to support use of the personas.
- Disseminate with documentation.

# Expected Outcomes
- Persona one-page profiles completed for ~ one dozen CTS roles
- Guidebook and sample use cases produced
- Educational webinar for first-time profile users

# Deliverables
* Personas 1-pager template
* Set of Persona 1-pagers, spanning the translational workforce
* User guide for employing the Personas with sample use cases
* Bibliography of sources on the CTS workforce
* Engagement and outreach to the CTSA hubs

# Timeline (monthly)
- 3/1/19 Identify roles in the CTS landscape
- 4/1/19 Choose elements for Persona templates
- 5/1/19 Inform Persona profiles from the literature
- 7/1/19 Inform Personas from interviews
- 8/1/19 Personas one-page documents completed
- 9/1/19 Personas guidebook and sample use cases
- 10/1/19 Evaluation of Personas understandability & impact completed

# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
- **Interviews to inform personas.** Per personas-writing best practices, the team would like to interview 3 people per role, but if time does not allow for that the team will complete the profiles based on lit reviews and empathy exercises for any roles lacking interviews.
- **Project is successfully wrapping up at this time.**
