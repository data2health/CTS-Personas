# Research Design
The concept of the translational workforce is an important one and plays a prominent role in the work and communication of CTSA Program hubs, NCATS, and beyond. However, to date, a defined list of translational workforce roles in CTS does not exist. Here, we aim to better define the specific roles included in the translational workforce, establish a set of personas to reflect those roles, construct a portfolio of these persona profiles, and disseminate broadly to the CTSA program and to the CD2H for use in development of use cases, communications, training materials, and more.

# Methodology
The Personas project represents a major multi-site collaboration with deep engagement by project partners.  The team meets every 2 weeks and is supported by clearly communicated expectations and timelines.  

This project will encompass and describe the diversity of roles in the clinical and translational science ecosystem. By identifying CTS roles, establishing a persona to represent each role, and providing each persona with a profile, we will document the needs, motivations, goals, and pain points in CTS roles that will be used to inform software development, use cases, teaching materials, and more for the CTSA community. The process includes:
- Identify relevant roles in CTS through a literature search, interviews, and other feedback
- Develop 1-pagers on each persona about that “person” – their job, motivations, pain points, types of types of data, software tools, training resources, etc. that each persona would want to access, etc.
- Get input and iterate
- Once in good shape, develop some exemplar use cases and documentation to support use of the personas.
- Disseminate with documentation.

# Expected Outcomes
- Persona one-page profiles completed for ~ one dozen CTS roles
- Guidebook and sample use cases produced
- Educational webinar for first-time profile users

# Deliverables
* Personas 1-pager template
* Set of Persona 1-pagers, spanning the translational workforce
* User guide for employing the Personas with sample use cases
* Bibliography of sources on the CTS workforce
* Engagement and outreach to the CTSA hubs

# Timeline (monthly)
- 3/1/19 Identify roles in the CTS landscape
- 4/1/19 Choose elements for Persona templates
- 5/1/19 Inform Persona profiles from the literature
- 7/1/19 Inform Personas from interviews
- 8/1/19 Personas one-page documents completed
- 9/1/19 Personas guidebook and sample use cases
- 10/1/19 Evaluation of Personas understandability & impact completed

# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
- **Interviews to inform personas.** Per personas-writing best practices, the team would like to interview 3 people per role, but if time does not allow for that the team will complete the profiles based on lit reviews and empathy exercises for any roles lacking interviews.
- **Project is successfully wrapping up at this time.**

# Y3 (July 1, 2019-June 30, 2020) Accomplishments 
The following content is from the June 30 - Dec 30, 2019 mid year progress report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLe3uCfEUakWxIJyi5SA4ZocYDmINvhySTperaui1Bw/edit).  Please add progress for Jan 1 - June 30th, 2020. 

* Personas 1-pager template
    * A comprehensive template was designed to include the most critical attributes necessary to be included in the final, robust persona 1-page profiles in order to make them useful to inform the development of resources and services for the translational science community:
      * Name
      * Photo
      * Quote
      * Descriptive Job Title
      * Major responsibilities (Incorporated in a “Bio” section)
      * Expertise: training, years on job, etc.
      * Workplace environment (Incorporated in a “Bio” section)
      * Software and data use at work
      * Technology attitude
      * Motivators
      * Goals
      * Wants/Needs
      * Pain points/Challenges
      * Scholarly output activities
      * Continuing Education Goals/Training Opportunities

    * Additionally, the CTS Personas feature a “deep-dive” on software usage.

    * The CTS-Personas project was scoped to one dozen profiles of roles in clinical and translational science. Though the six-month project timeframe precluded producing additional profiles, we encourage anyone with an interest in creating additional CTS profiles to reference our [Methodology](https://data2health.github.io/CTS-Personas/pages/methodology/methodology.html) so they may use our evidence-based approach to create their own personas. 

* Set of Persona 1-pagers, spanning the translational workforce:
    * 100% complete. We have completed all of [our proposed one page profiles](https://data2health.github.io/CTS-Personas/pages/profiles/). This includes two patient profiles in addition to the one dozen CTS roles. The Persona profiles represent a diversity of roles across the ecosystem of translational research. These profiles are intended for use for the CTSA Program community and beyond to assist those who develop resources and services for the translational workforce, such as software tools, training workshops, communication materials, and more.
    
* User guide for employing the Personas with sample use cases:
    * Our [guidebook and sample use cases](https://data2health.github.io/CTS-Personas/pages/user_guidebook.html) are complete and available for use and ongoing feedback. The Guidebook can be consulted for keys to the Profiles, sample use cases, a bibliography, and credits. [Download the Guidebook through DigitalHub](https://doi.org/10.18131/g3-db0b-ad10) or access the [Use Cases](https://data2health.github.io/CTS-Personas/pages/use_cases/) directly. A template has also been created and [deposited in the project site](https://github.com/data2health/CTS-Personas/tree/master/Profiles%20Documents).
    
* Bibliography of sources on the CTS workforce:
    * 100% complete.  [Slides](https://digitalhub.northwestern.edu/files/86c74821-e12c-4263-b33a-d005870505a5) 17-23. (DOI:[10.18131/g3-db0b-ad10](https://doi.org/10.18131/g3-db0b-ad10))
    
* Engagement and outreach to the CTSA hubs:
    * Our efforts to engage and connect with CTSA hubs is ongoing and robust. Up until project work was completed in September 2019, weekly meetings were held with partners at OHSU, Wash U and CHOP.  Attendees included bioinformatics experts, data engineers, and librarians. Some examples to highlight engagement efforts are outlined below:

      * June 18, 2019. Video call with members of NYU Health Sciences Library to share our work. Members of the NYU team later joined CD2H and are contributing or mailing list members of the Personas project.
      * October 10, 2019. Video call with CD2H onboarded member, Eric Miller, to share more about Personas and how they can be used. 
      * Created and distributed Personas trading cards. These trading cards have been given to various members of CTS hubs. (trading cards exist in hard copy only).
      * CTSA fall meeting, Arlington, VA, Sept. 26-27: Sara Gonzales, Personas lead, attended and staffed the CD2H table with Personas 1-pager handouts and trading cards.
       * The webinar was held on November 11, 2019 to 30 attendees.  Slides can be found here and recording here. 
      * Sara Gonzales presented on a use case of Personas at the Code4Lib Fall Chicago meeting, November 13, 2019.  
      * Emails about Personas activities have been sent to the following listservs: Medical Library Association (MLA) translational SIG, MLA MolBio SIG, MLA leadership section, the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL), Research Impact Services, ALA ScholComm, Transforming Research
      * The project and outputs have been shared widely on Twitter, targeting #CTSAProgram, #medlibs, #datalibs, and events such as the CTSA Program fall meeting, the Coalition for Networked Information fall meeting, and others.
      * Manuscript “Personas for the Translational Workforce” has been peer-reviewed and accepted for Spring publication in the Journal Of Clinical and Translational Science.
