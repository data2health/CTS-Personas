## Scope of the Personas project

Scope: To define the translational workforce, including clearly identified and defined roles. Develop a portfolio of personas to represent these roles.

Timeline: Biweekly meetings for roughly six months, February through August 2019

### Goals/Objectives
1. Identify relevant roles in CTSAs, informatics, data science, etc. through a literature search and interviews
2. Evaluate/discuss/design a persona template based on existing examples
3. Develop 1-pagers on each persona about that “person” – their job, motivations, pain points, and the types of data, software tools, training resources, etc. that each persona would want to access
4. Get input from the iDTF and other DTFs, administrators, project members, etc.
5. Develop exemplar use cases and documentation to support use of the personas.
6. Post with documentation and a mechanism for ongoing input from the broader CTS community

### Outputs
1.	The Personas 1-pager
2. 	Bibliography of sources on the CTS workforce
3. 	Engagement and outreach to the CTSA hubs
