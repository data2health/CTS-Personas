# Scope of the Personas project

Scope: To define the translational workforce, including clearly identified and defined roles. Develop a portfolio of personas to represent these roles.

Timeline: Biweekly meetings for roughly six months, February through August 2019

## Goals/Objectives
* Identify relevant roles in CTSAs, informatics, data science, etc. through a literature search and interviews
* Evaluate/discuss/design a persona template based on existing examples
* Develop 1-pagers on each persona about that “person” – their job, motivations, pain points, and the types of data, software tools, training resources, etc. that each persona would want to access
* Get input from the iDTF and other DTFs, administrators, project members, etc.
* Develop exemplar use cases and documentation to support use of the personas.
* Post with documentation and a mechanism for ongoing input from the broader CTS community
