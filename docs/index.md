CTS Personas, a project of the National Center for Data to Health (Grant U24TR002306), is an effort to create Persona profiles representing roles across the ecosystem of translational research: Basic Research → Pre-Clinical Research → Clinical Research → Clinical Implementation → Public Health. These profiles are intended for use for the CTSA community and beyond, to assist those developing software projects, educational and communication materials, and more.
