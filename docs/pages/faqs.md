### I don't see my postion among the personas. Why was my position left out?
The scope of CTS-Personas was the production of one dozen profiles of roles in clinical and translational science. Though the six-month project timeframe preculded producing additional profiles, we encourage anyone with an interest in creating additional CTS profiles to reference our [Methodology](/pages/methodology.md) and begin their own journey of Persona creation.
