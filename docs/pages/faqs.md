### A key role is missing from the CTS-Persona library, what can I do? 
The CTS-Personas project was scoped to one dozen profiles of roles in clinical and translational science. Though the six-month project timeframe precluded producing additional profiles, we encourage anyone with an interest in creating additional CTS profiles to reference our [Methodology](../pages/methodology/methodology.md) and begin a journey of Persona creation. 

Keen to round out the collection of personas with a key role at your hub? Looking for a straightforward project for a student or collaborative workgroup? Consider developing a Persona and contribute it to the CTS-Personas library!
