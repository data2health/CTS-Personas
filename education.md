## CTS Personas Education Plan

A focus on education is part of the overall goal of the Personas project. In addition, the Personas team will produce specific educational deliverables that will introduce the CD2H community to the Persona profiles and provide them with recommendations on how best to make use of them.

### Personas as a tool to support education

Each Persona profile will include a section on the professional development goals of CTS employees in particular roles. This information, gleaned through a combination of interviews and literature reviews, will demonstrate the educational needs of members of the CTS workforce.

### Educational resources to maximize use of the Personas

The final deliverables of the CTS Personas project will be a series of educational documents and tools. The first will be the Persona profiles themselves, which are tools which will help developers, educational resource designers, and communication managers to develop their resources and communcation tools to meet the needs of a diverse workforce.

The second educational resource we will produce will be an instructional webinar on how to use the Persona profiles. The third will be a guidebook containing sample scenarios and use cases in which the Persona profiles can be leveraged. Both of these resources will contain practical tips for understanding, using, and benefitting from the Persona profiles.

Like the Personas profiles themselves, our team plans to market the availability of the associated edicational resources to ensure that they are leveraged by CD2H educatoinal activities.
